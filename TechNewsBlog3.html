In a statement posted to X late Tuesday, OpenAI said it had reached an agreement “in principle” for Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO. OpenAI, headquartered in San Francisco, revealed the potential reinstatement of Altman along with the formation of a new initial board comprising prominent figures from the tech industry. The company\'s statement, cited in the AP report, stated, "We have agreed in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board made up of former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and Quora CEO Adam D\'Angelo". The previous board of directors at OpenAI, including D\'Angelo, had declined to provide specific reasons for Altman\'s dismissal, leading to internal discord and external pressure from the startup\'s investors over the weekend. The decision to terminate Altman without clear notice prompted an employee-driven petition demanding the resignations of the board members and Altman\'s reinstatement.', additionalContent:'OpenAI, initially founded as a nonprofit organization with the goal of developing safe artificial general intelligence, transitioned to a for-profit company while maintaining its nonprofit board structure. Following Altman\'s departure, with only four members remaining on the board, a change in composition and new leadership became necessary. Amidst the leadership crisis, Greg Brockman made a notable appearance on social media, announcing the launch of ChatGPT Voice, a feature aimed at enhancing the ChatGPT experience. This announcement coincided with a lighthearted demonstration from OpenAI\'s main account on X, emphasizing workforce unity while subtly acknowledging the recent upheaval.', image: 'https://lifeboat.com/blog.images/openai-to-soon-release-a-new-open-source-ai-model3.jpg' },

India has been tightening regulations of social media companies, which count the South Asian nation as a top growth market.Last year, the government privately criticized the companies for not removing what it described as fake news on their sites, which it said had forced it to order  content takedowns.

While ChatGPT was launched almost a year back, Bing and Bard were unveiled in February this year. And now, Elon Musk is all set to enter the generative AI chatbot market with Grok AI.Earlier this month, the X owner had announced Grok AI chatbot. Unveiling the same, XAI team had said that it will answer spicy questions chatbots a void. The chatbot will also have a rebellious streak and won\'t be a good fit for those who lack a sense of humour. And now, Musk has shared a tentative timeline for Grok AI\'s launch. And it is sooner than you think.We could be interacting the GrokAI as soon as next week. However, Musk didn\'t specify an exact date. It is to be noted that GrokAI will only be available to X Premium users. This means that those who don\'t pay to use X won\'t be available to use the new AI chatbot.Announcing GrokAI\'s launch next week, Musk wrote, Grok should be available to all X Premium+ subscribers next week.', additionalContent:'Announcing its upcoming AI assistant that will answer questions with wit and also has a rebellious streak,the XAI team wrote in a tweet that those who lack a sense of humour shouldn\’t use the AI service.The team\'s post read, Grok is an AI modeled after the Hitchhiker\’s Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask. Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don\’t use it if you hate humor.The team then added that Grok will have real-time knowledge of the world due to X. This could mean that the AI system will derive its knowledge from the users publicly available Twitter posts.In addition to this, the AI system will also answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.The product is still in beta stage and has been trained for just 2 months. The xAI team added that it will improve rapidly with each passing week with your help.', image: 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/styles/medium_crop_simple/public/2023-11/musk_0.png?VersionId=Ohrv3hvJzID7mTm7R.ifjtOj7DrmjjAz.jpg' },

A recent study from Randstad, the recruitment company, found that job posts referencing generative AI skills have risen by 2,000% since March. It\’s the third most sought-after skill set and one of the shortest in supply.The logical step for enterprise companies is to appoint a chief AI officer (CAIO) to kickstart their efforts. Earlier this year, Dylan Fox penned an opinion piece arguing that every Fortune 500 business needs a CAIO.Companies that do not integrate AI into their product, operations, and business strategy will struggle to remain competitive — and fall behind those that do, Fox wrote.It\’s a compelling argument that makes sense at the enterprise level. But what about everyone else? Startups and scale-ups need to integrate AI just as badly — especially if they\’re trying to fundraise in this AI moment. However, they often don\’t have the resources or the organizational structure to support a senior executive focused exclusively on AI.', additionalContent:'This is where a fractional AI officer comes in. Fractional leadership is a recent workforce trend: seasoned executives with subject matter expertise working across two or more clients simultaneously, lending their talents to rapidly growing companies that need their specific skill set but can’t afford it full-time.Here\’s the kicker: Having a fractional AI officer is superior to hiring full-time in one crucial respect. AI — especially generative AI — is such a new technology that breadth of experience across multiple companies gives fractional executives an edge over their full-time counterparts.',image: 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1419366342.jpg?w=1390&crop=1.jpg' }
